This number is not adjusted for metabolism.

Calculation of PNEC PNEC = 480 µg/L ÷ 10 PNEC = 48 µg/L The PNEC was calculated from the NOEC of the most sensitive species, daphnia, divided by an assessment factor of 10. An assessment factor of 10 was used since chronic data are available for algae, crustaceans and fish. PEC/PNEC Ratio PEC/PNEC = 0,0019 ÷ 48 = 0,00004 The PEC/PNEC ratio of less than 0.1 justifies the phrase “Use of tadalafil has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” DEGRADATION CLASSIFICATION Biotic Degradation Ready degradability: Tadalifil has not been tested for ready biodegradability. However, tadalafil is assumed to be not readily biodegradable given the small amount of 14CO2 evolved (~5% of applied radioactivity) when 14C-tadalafil was incubated with sewage sludge for 85 days (Study 1982.6287, OECD 302A, a test of inherent degradability). Inherent degradability: Tadalafil is transformed (DT50 = 9 days) to more polar hydroxylated metabolites when incubated with activated sewage sludge under aerobic conditions (SCAS test, modified from OECD 302A; Study 1982.6287). Simulation study: Tadalafil was transformed in two water-sediment systems in which radiolabelled tadalafil was incubated under aerobic conditions for 108 days (OECD 308; Study 1982.6288). Parent tadalafil disappeared from the overlying water with a DT50 of approximately 4 days. Dissipation of tadalafil was due to partitioning to sediment and to primary and ultimate degradation. The sediment was extracted three times with solvent systems of varying polarity (1. Acetonitrile, 2. Acetonitrile:water 80:20, 3. Acetonitrile:water:hydrochloric acid 80:20:0.1 v:v) and the pooled extract was characterized for parent and transformation products. By the end of the study, several polar transformation products were observed and 1,8% and 3,4% of the applied radioactivity evolved as 14CO2 over the 108 day study. Approximately 25% and 30% of the radioactivity could not be extracted from the sediment. The calculated half-lives for dissipation of tadalafil from the whole system (via degradation and irreversible binding to sediment) were 70 and 117 days. Abiotic Degradation Tadalafil is stable with respect to hydrolysis (OECD 111; Study 1982.6281). Based on the lack of observed degradation in the algae toxicity study (Study 1982.6290) under continuous light conditions for 72 hours, tadalafil is stable with respect to photolysis. Justification of the degradation phrase: Tadalafil disappeared from water sediment systems with half-lives of 70 and 117 days and there was evidence of biotransformation and mineralization. Therefore, the degradation phrase “Tadalafil is slowly degraded in the environment” is based on the fate in water-sediment systems. Bioaccumulation Partition coefficient: The octanol/water partition coefficient of 2,32 was determined using an HPLC correlation method (EEC Method A8, Study 303/688). As tadalafil has no ionizable groups, this value is appropriate over an environmentally relevant range of pH. As the log Kow is less than 3 and the compound is subject to extensive metabolism, tadalafil is not expected to bioaccumulate in biotic tissues. Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: The octanol-water partition coefficient is less than 4, justifying the use of the phrase “Tadalafil has low potential for bioaccumulation.” Excretion (metabolism) In humans, tadalafil is transformed into metabolites that are at least 45 times less potent based on in vitro phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition. Based on quantification of residue excretion in humans, one-third, at most, of the total dose is excreted as tadalafil. Thus, human metabolism can be estimated to reduce the amount of tadalafil that reaches the sewage treatment facility by at least two-thirds. For this risk assessment, however, a worst-case total residues approach will be taken; that is, tadalafil and its human metabolites will be considered to have the same activity. PBT/vPvB ASSESSMENT Although a bioconcentration factor has not been empirically determined, tadalafil is not considered bioaccumulative because the log octanol-water partition coefficient value is less than 4 and because tadalafil is subject to metabolism. The chronic aquatic NOEC values are all greater than 10 µg/L. The effects of tadalafil in mammals have been summarized elsewhere. The pharmacological target of tadalafil in mammals is not a hormone receptor. Because tadalafil does not meet the criteria for bioaccumulative or toxicity, it is not considered to be PBT or vPvB.
