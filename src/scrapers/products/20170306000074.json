Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 9.98 x10-5 μg/L Where: A = 0.7280 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2021, data from IQVIA Health). R = 0% removal rate (conservatively, it has been assumed there is no loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation). P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae: No data Water flea (Daphnia magna): Acute toxicity EC50 48 h (immobility) > 12 μg/L (OECD 202) (Reference 4) NOEC = 12 μg/L Chronic toxicity No data Fish (Pimephales promelas): Acute toxicity No data Chronic toxicity LOEC 116 days > 0.58 μg/L (OECD 210/234) (Reference 8) NOEC = 0.58 μg/L Other ecotoxicity data: Microorganisms in activated sludge: EC50 3 h (inhibition) > 1,000,000 μg/L @ 3 hrs (OECD 209) (Reference 4) Earthworm (Eisenia foetida): LC50 14 days (lethality) > 1,000,000 μg/kg (OECD 207) (Reference 5) NOEC = 1,000,000 μg/Kg PNEC = 0.58/10 = 0.058 μg/L PNEC (μg/L) = lowest NOEC/10, where 10 is the assessment factor applied for one long-term NOECs but where there is a high degree of confidence that the dataset includes the most sensitive species (fish) and addresses the specific mode of action (endocrine disruption). On this basis the NOEC for fish has been used in the calculation. PNEC Justification According to the European Medicines Agency guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), use of Fluticasone furoate is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment, because the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is below the action limit 0.01 μg/L. However, fluticasone furoate is a glucocorticoid and, as such, is considered as a potential endocrine active substance and therefore the potential endocrine activity of this compound was investigated in an appropriate chronic vertebrate test system with relevant end points. Accordingly, GSK has conducted a fish early life-stage test, as per OECD 210, as a range-finder to set concentrations for an extended early life-stage test, exposing newly fertilised embryos until they reached sexual maturity (OECD 234). This study concluded that no statistically significant effects were observed between the controls and any of the test concentrations in terms of hatching success, post-hatch survival, growth, spawning ability or secondary sexual characteristics. Due to the mode of action of fluticasone furoate and its potential to act as an endocrine active substance there is a high degree of confidence that fish is the most sensitive species and on that basis there is a strong justification for applying an AF of 10 (Reference 1). Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 9.98 x10-5 /0.058 = 1.72 x10-3, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase “Use of fluticasone furoate has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: No Data Inherent degradability: 0% degradation in 28 days (OECD 302C) (Reference 7) Soil Metabolism: 3% degradation in 64 days (OECD 304) (Reference 6) Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: No data Photolysis: No data Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Fluticasone furoate is not readily degradable or inherently degradable but it is slowly degraded in soil. The phrase “fluticasone furoate is potentially persistent” is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Kow = 2.61 at pH 7 (OECD 117) (Reference 5) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Kow < 4 at pH 7, the substance has a low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/h) from systemic circulation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17β-carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17β-carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have revealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone. Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous administration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following intravenous administration, the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1 % and 2 % of the orally and intravenously administered dose, respectively. (Reference 2). PBT/vPvB assessment Fluticasone furoate does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vPvB All three properties, i.e. ‘P’, ‘B’ and ‘T’ are required in order to classify a compound as PBT (Reference 1). Fluticasone furoate does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP based on log Pow < 4. Please, also see Safety data sheets on http://www.msds-gsk.com/ExtMSDSlist.asp.

NOEC for alga (= 95.40 ug/L) has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive of the three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 8.22 x 10-6/9.54 = 8.62 x 10-7, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase “Use of umeclidinium has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: No data Inherent degradability: No data Simulation studies: Water-sediment study: No data Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: No data Photolysis: No data Justification of chosen degradation phrase: There are no degradation data available for Umeclidinium. The phrase “The potential for persistence of Umeclidinium cannot be excluded, due to lack of data” is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Dow = 1.35 at pH 7 (OECD 107) (Reference 2) Log Dow at pH 5 = 0.092 Log Dow at pH 7 = 1.35 Log Dow at pH 9 = 1.39 Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Dow < 4, the substance has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not been established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous administration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered radioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of the drug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following oral administration to healthy male volunteers, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours in healthy volunteers, with 3% to 4% excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state (Reference 5). PBT/vPvB assessment Umeclidinium does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP. All three properties, i.e. ‘P’, ‘B’ and ‘T’ are required in order to classify a compound as PBT (Reference 1). Umeclidinium does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP based on a log Dow < 4. Please, also see Safety data sheets on http://www.msds-gsk.com/ExtMSDSlist.asp.

Excretion (metabolism) In vitro studies showed that vilanterol is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for vilanterol are O-dealkylation to a range of metabolites with significantly reduced beta1- and beta2-adrenergic agonist activity. Plasma metabolic profiles following oral administration of vilanterol in a human radiolabel study were consistent with high first-pass metabolism. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. Plasma clearance of vilanterol following intravenous administration was 108 litres/hour. Following oral administration of radiolabelled vilanterol, mass balance showed 70% of the radiolabel in urine and 30% in faeces. Primary elimination of vilanterol was by metabolism followed by excretion of metabolites in urine and faeces. Vilanterol plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 11 hours (Reference 62). PBT/vPvB assessment Vilanterol does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP.
