Nedbrytning: Det kan inte uteslutas att umeklidinium är persistent, då data saknas. Bioackumulering: Umeklidinium har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Detailed background information Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R)/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 8.22 x 10-6 μg/L Where: A = 0.06 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2020, data from IQVIA). R = 0% removal rate (conservatively, it has been assumed there is no loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Green Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata): IC50 96h (yield) = 910 μg/L (OECD 201) (Reference 2) NOEC = 95.40 μg/L Water flea: Acute toxicity No data Water flea (Daphnia magna): Chronic toxicity NOEC 21 days (reproduction) = 6,250 μg/L (OECD 211) (Reference 3) Rainbow Trout: Acute toxicity No data Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas): Chronic toxicity NOEC 28 days (reproduction) = 370 μg/L (OECD 210) (Reference 4) Other ecotoxicity data: Chironomid No data Microorganisms in activated sludge No data PNEC = 95.40/10 = 9.54 μg/L PNEC (μg/L) = lowest NOEC/10, where 10 is the assessment factor applied for three long-term NOECs. NOEC for alga (= 95.40 ug/L) has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive of the three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 8.22 x 10-6/9.54 = 8.62 x 10-7, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase “Use of umeclidinium has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: No data Inherent degradability: No data Simulation studies: Water-sediment study: No data Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: No data Photolysis: No data Justification of chosen degradation phrase: There are no degradation data available for Umeclidinium. The phrase “The potential for persistence of Umeclidinium cannot be excluded, due to lack of data” is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Dow = 1.35 at pH 7 (OECD 107) (Reference 2) Log Dow at pH 5 = 0.092 Log Dow at pH 7 = 1.35 Log Dow at pH 9 = 1.39 Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Dow < 4, the substance has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not been established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous administration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered radioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of the drug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following oral administration to healthy male volunteers, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. Less than 1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting negligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours in healthy volunteers, with 3% to 4% excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state (Reference 5). PBT/vPvB assessment Umeclidinium does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP. All three properties, i.e. ‘P’, ‘B’ and ‘T’ are required in order to classify a compound as PBT (Reference 1). Umeclidinium does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP based on a log Dow < 4. Please, also see Safety data sheets on http://www.msds-gsk.com/ExtMSDSlist.asp.
