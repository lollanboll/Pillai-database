Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.5*10-6*A*(100-R) Where: A = 2.83 kg (total sales data in Sweden in 2019 from IQVIA database). R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0 if no data is available P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 9 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default (1)) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default (1)) Based on this formula and data the PEC was calculated as 0.00043 μg/L = 0.43 ng/L. Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae (Desmodesmus subspicatus): (2) EC50 72 h (growth inhibition, growth rate) = 460 μg/L, NOEC 72 h = 117 µg/L (OECD TG 201). Crustacean (waterflea Daphnia magna): Acute toxicity EC50 48 h (immobilization) = 6400 μg/L (OECD TG 202). (3) Chronic toxicity NOEC 21 days (reproduction) = ≥ 387 μg/L (FDA TAD 4.09). (4) Fish: Acute toxicity (rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) LC50 96 h (mortality) = 1600 μg/L (FDA TAD 4.11). (5) Chronic toxicity (fathead minnow Pimephales promelas) NOEC 300 days (life-cycle test; growth, sexual development) = 0.001 μg/L (guideline EPA FIFRA Subdev.E,72-5). (6) Chronic toxicity (zebrafish Danio rerio) NOEC 177d (2-generation test: growth, sexual development, reproduction (F0), hatching, growth, sexual development, reproduction (F1) = 0.0003 µg/L. (7) The lowest chronic NOEC or EC10 was determined with fish (D. rerio) and used to calculate the PNEC applying an assessment factor of 10: 0.0003 µg/L / 10 = 0.00003 µg/L = 0.03 ng/L. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) The PEC/PNEC ratio calculates as 0.43 ng/L / 0.03 ng/L = 14,3, i.e. the ratio is >10 which justifies the phrase \"Use of ethinylestradiol has been considered to result in high environmental risk.\" Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: not ready biodegradable Ethinylestradiol was studied for aerobic biodegradability in water in a CO2 evolution test according to guideline FDA TAD 3.11 (8). Ethinylestradiol was introduced into the test system at a concentration of 10 mg/L as carbon. It was only marginally degraded to 3 % after 28 days. A study on transformation in aquatic/sediment systems according to test guideline OECD 308 was conducted (9). The transformation of [14C] ethinylestradiol in sediments and natural water was assessed in three different aerobic sediment/water systems. The disappearance half-lifes of [14C] ethinylestradiol were in the overlying water of aerobic systems 4.0 and 5.9 days for the high and low organic carbon content, respectively. Since for one of the low organic carbon content sediment the total mass balance was not reached as recommended in the guideline OECD 308 (≥ 90%), this result was not further evaluated. The extraction from sediments were performed by the following method, which was validated for spiked sediments prior to application to test samples: The sediment is extracted by using 50 mL acetonitrile:water, 80:20, v:v as extraction solvent. If more than 5 % of the applied amount is found in the second extract the sediment is extracted a third time using acetonitrile:1 M HCl 80:20, v:v. A portion of the combined extracts was then reduced by rotary evaporation at 40 °C and at least 60 mbar. The concentrated sample was then analyzed by HPLC for parent compound and extractable metabolites. The parent compound was recovered to 0% from all water and sediment samples at day 99. Only slight ultimate biodegradation was observed in the test systems. The accumulative amount of evolved 14CO2 for the aerobic test systems was 2.5 and 5.1% of the applied radioactivity. Primary degradation was observed for ethinylestradiol to a low degree in the water/sediment test samples. One metabolite occurred only occasionally. Most of the introduced radioactivity was sediment-bound (50-62%). In the total water/sediment systems the DT50 of [14C] ethinylestradiol was 24, 36, and 28 days for the 2 systems. The DT50 values differed ranked in two cases below the FASS criterion of 32 days and exceeded this threshold in one case. Since two of three water-sediment systems report DT50 below the criterion and the exceedance of one system is moderate, ethinylestradiol can be classified as being degradable. Due to the results of the water-sediment study with a total system half-life of < 32d, the use of the phrase “ethinylestradiol is degraded in the environment” is justified. Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: Ethinylestradiol is hydrolytically stable (pH 7, 25ºC) (FDA TAD 3.09) (10) Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log KOW 4.2 (Shake flask method, FDA TAD 3.02). (10) A bioaccumulation study with ethinylestradiol was conducted in the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus (11). The fish were exposed to concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/L [14C] ethinylestradiol. over 35 days with a subsequent depuration phase of 29 days. The steady state bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for total radioactive residue were 371 and 634 for the 1.0 and 10 ng/L treatment level, respectively. The steady state bioconcentration factors for total radioactive residue (TRR) based on lipid content of 3.61 % were 10287 at the 1.0 ng/L treatment level and 17553 at the 10 ng/L treatment level. Normalised to 6 % fat tissue, the BCFss for total radioactive residues for whole fish are 617 and 1053 for the 1.0 and 10 ng/L treatment levels, respectively. Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log KOW was 4.2 and BCF was 371-634 (617-1035 normalized on 6% fat), the trigger of a BCF of 500 was exceeded. Therefore, the substance was considered to have a high potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Ethinylestradiol is introduced mainly metabolized as glucoronides and oxidized products (12) (13). PBT/vPvB assessment Ethinylestradiol is not PBT or vPvB as the BCF of the substance is clearly below the thresholds of 2000 and 5000.

Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A*(100-R) = 0.0013 μg/L Where: A = 9.36 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2021, data from IQVIA / LIF) R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0 if no data is available P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference I) D = factor for dilution of wastewater by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference I) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies* Algae (green algae, Desmodesmus subspicatus): NOEC 72 hours (growth rate) = 5.6 μg/L, ErC50 72 hours (growth rate) = 25.3 μg/L. Guideline OECD 201. (Reference II) Crustacean (waterflea, Daphnia magna): Chronic toxicity NOEC 21 days (reproduction) ≥ 752 μg/L. Guideline OECD 211. (Reference III) Fish (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas): Chronic toxicity EC10 21 days (reproduction) = 0.00001 μg/L. Guideline OECD 229. (Reference IV) Fish (zebrafish, Danio rerio): Chronic toxicity NOEC 126 days (reproduction) = 0.00016 μg/L. Guideline OECD 210. (Reference V) The PNEC was calculated by division of the lowest effect level (NOEC) of the fish full life cycle study considering an appropriate assessment factor (AF). The most sensitive taxonomic group were fish, and the lowest relevant effect level was reported as EC10 = 0.00016 µg/L. The regulatory default standard AF of 10 was used, which is applicable when there are chronic aquatic toxicity studies representing the three trophic levels (algae, crustaceans, and fish). PNEC = 0.00016 µg/L / 10 = 0.000016 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) The risk quotient PEC/PNEC was calculated with 0.0013 µg/L / 0.000016 µg/L = 81.3. Justification of chosen environmental risk phrase: A risk quotient above 10 qualifies for the phrase “Use of levonorgestrel has been considered to result in high environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: Levonorgestrel was also studied for aerobic biodegradability in water in a manometric respiration test according to guideline OECD 301F. The test item was introduced into the test system at a concentration of 200 mg/L as theoretically oxidizable carbon. The study reported 0 % biodegradation of levonorgestrel in 28 days. Guideline OECD 301F. (Reference VI) Simulation studies: A study on transformation in aquatic/sediment systems according to test guideline OECD 308 was conducted. The transformation of [14C] levonorgestrel in sediments and natural water was assessed in two different aerobic sediment/water systems. Levonorgestrel was incubated in glass vessels containing sediment and overlaying water over 100 days. The entire sediment sample was extracted first with acetonitrile, afterwards with acetonitrile/water, 70/30, v/v and acetonitrile/water/HCl, 70/30/5, v/v/v until the last extract contained ≤ 5% of the applied radioactivity. The samples were shaken for 5 minutes and thereafter centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred into a graduated cylinder. In cases where a phase separation was observed, portions of 20 mL of Milli- Q water were added to the extracts until no separation was visible anymore. The total volume was recorded and duplicate 1 mL aliquots were measured by LSC for radioactivity. The results of the study indicate that levonorgestrel is distributed to the sediment compartment, however, relevant amounts remained in the water phase (22 and 43 % for the fine and coarse sediment, respectively). The degradation rate was 6-7 % at the end of the incubation period. The DT50 (disappearance half-life from the water phase) for parent compound in water was estimated with 2.5 and 3.2 days for the fine and coarse sediment, respectively. This study reported a half-life of levonorgestrel in water DT50 = 2-5-3.2 days while the DT50 in sediment/total system could not be determined and the substance is considered potentially persistent in the environment. Guideline OECD 308. (Reference VII) Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: Levonorgestrel was reported to be resistant to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7, and 9 and 25 °C. Guideline FDA TAD 3.09. (Reference VIII) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Levonorgestrel established a DT50 > 120 d for the total system and is resistant to hydrolysis, which qualifies for the phrase “Levonorgestrel is potentially persistent.” Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: The log Dow was reported as 3.55. Guideline FDA TAD 3.02. (Reference IX) Bioconcentration factor (BCF): Fish (bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus) were exposed in two treatment groups to 14C-labeled levonorgestrel for 28 days followed by a depuration phase of 14 days. The mean measured concentration of levonorgestrel (based on 14C analysis) was 6.1 and 42.1 ng/L for the low and high concentration, respectively, during the exposure phase. The concentration of 14C in fish tissue decreased rapidly during the exposure phase most likely due to increased metabolization and subsequent rapid excretion. The BCFss (bioconcentration factor at steady state) was 250 and 119 for group 2 and 3, respectively. Normalized to a standard lipid content of 5 % the BCFss calculated as 192 and 92 for group 2 and 3, respectively. Guideline OECD 305. (Reference X) Other data Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: As the log Dow was < 4 and/or BCF < 500 levonorgestrel is not considered bioaccumulative which qualifies for the phrase “Levonorgestrel has low potential for bioaccumulation.” Excretion (metabolism) Systemically available levonorgestrel is mainly excreted in the hydroxylated and to a lesser extent, in a conjugated form. Only a small fraction is released unchanged. (Reference XI) References Guidance on information requirements and Chemical Safety Assessment Chapter R.16: Environmental exposure assessment.
