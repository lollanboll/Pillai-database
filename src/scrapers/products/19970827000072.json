        "env-effect": "Irbesartan Miljörisk: Användning av irbesartan har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Irbesartan bryts ned långsamt i miljön. Bioackumulering: Irbesartan har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (µg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A*(100-R) PEC = 0.184 µg/L Where: A = 1342.937 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2022, data from IQVIA) R = 0% removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA, 2008; Ref I). D = factor of dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA, 2008; Ref I). Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata): EC50 72 h (biomass): 79 000 μg/L NOEC: 7200 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 201) (Ref II) EC50 72 h (growth inhibition): 460 000 μg/L NOEC: 23 000 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 201) (Ref II) Crustacean (Daphnia magna): EC50 48 h (immobilization): 191 000 μg/L NOEC 48 h: 86 400 μg/L (Protocol: FDA 4.08/OECD 202) (Ref III) EC50 21 days (reduction in reproduction): 15 600 μg/L NOEC 21 days (reduction in reproduction): 10 400 μg/L LOEC 21 days (reduction in reproduction): 23 300 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 211) (Ref IV) Fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss): LC50 96 h (mortality) > 290 000 μg/lL (Protocol: OECD 203) (Ref IV) Fish (Pimephales promelas): NOEC 28 days (growth): 7040 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 210) (Ref VI) Other ecotoxicity data: PNEC = 704 µg/L, lowest EC50/10 using results from the most sensitive chronic toxicity endpoint and an assessment factor of 10 (Long-term results from at least three species of the base set), to add a safety margin to the toxicity endpoint. The most sensitive species was Pimephales promelas for which the NOEC 28 days (growth) was 7040 μg/L. Environmental Risk Classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC= 0.184/704 = 0.000261, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase: “Use of Irbesartan has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: Test results showed 22.5 % degradation in 28 days (FDA 3.11/OECD 301) (Ref VII) Simulation studies DT50 in water: DT50total system = 8.7 (sediment 1) -12.5 (sediment 2) days. At the end of the study, there were 17.9% (sediment 1) and 23.9% (sediment 2) of parent compound remaining (in 100 days). Ambient extractions were carried out by shaking the sediment/solvent mixture at room temperature for 20 min. Reflux extraction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. The extract solution and sediment solids were separated by centrifugation. The non-extractable radioactivity in selected samples, where this was greater than 10 % of the applied radioactivity, was characterized using an acid/base fractionation procedure. (Protocol: OECD 308) (Ref VIII) Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: The half-life of Irbesartan was 40.1 days at pH 7, 25°C . (Protocol: FDA 3.09/OECD111) (Ref IX) Photolysis: Test showed a half-life of 6.41 h at pH 7. (Protocol: FDA 3.10) (Ref X) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Irbesartan fails to pass the criteria for ready biodegradability. As DT50total system < 32 days with still more than 15 % of the parent compounds remaining at the end of the study, the correct phrase is: “Irbesartan is slowly degraded in the environment”. Bioaccumulation Partition coefficient: Log Kow = 1.13 at pH 7 (OECD 107) (Ref XI) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Kow < 4 at pH 7, irbesartan has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) The substance is excreted almost exclusively as metabolites with only 2 % as unchanged. (Ref XII) Metabolites identified are (1) Tetrazole N2-beta-glucuronide conjugate of irbesartan, (2) monohydroxylated metabolite resulting from omega-1 oxidation of the butyl side chain, (3, 4) two different monohydroxylated metabolites resulting from oxidation of the spirocyclopentane ring, (5) a diol resulting from omega-1 oxidation of the butyl side chain and oxidation of the spirocyclopentane ring, (6) a keto metabolite resulting from further oxidation of the omega-1 monohydroxy metabolite, (7) a keto-alcohol resulting from further oxidation of the omega-1 hydroxyl of the diol, and (8) a carboxylic acid metabolite resulting from oxidation of the terminal methyl group of the butyl side chain. (Ref XIII) The pharmacological activity of the metabolites is not known. References ECHA, European Chemicals Agency, 2008 Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment.
