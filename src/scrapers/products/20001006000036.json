Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation PEC/PNEC = 0.724 µg/L/100 µg/L = 0.0072 PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 Environmental Risk Classification Total sales of esomeprazole and omeprazole are included in the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC), as a worst case, as esomeprazole is the S-enantiomer of the racemate omeprazole and the toxicity is assumed to be very similar. Only short-term (acute) toxicity data are available for omeprazole (A2E303_Pharmaceutical in the environment_A4_Final_V4.pdf (astrazeneca.com). Therefore, in the absence of comprehensive environmental data for omeprazole, the more scientifically robust long-term data set for esomeprazole has been used to generate the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC). These data are in accordance with the EU European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline (ref. 1). Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 0.724 μg/L Where: A = 5287.85 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2020, data from IQVIA). This figure is based on sales figures (142.85 kg esomeprazole magnesium + 867.24 kg esomeprazole magnesiumdihydrate + 38.29 kg esomeprazole magnesiumtrihydrate + 73.89 kg esomeprazole sodium + 4134.06 kg omeprazole + 31.52 kg omeprazolmagnesium). R = X % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0 if no data is available. P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Ref. I) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Ref. I) (Note: The factor 109 converts the quantity used from kg to μg). Metabolism After administration, esomeprazole and omeprazole are almost completely metabolised, with <1% found in urine as the parent compound. Approximately 80% of the metabolites are excreted by urine and approximately 20% via faeces. The two main excreted human metabolites are both excreted via urine, and are considerably less pharmacologically active than the parent compounds (ref. 3). The total residue approach considered here is considered worst-case in terms of environmental risk. Ecotoxicity data - Esomeprazole Endpoint Species Common Name Method Time Result Ref.

Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Long-term tests of esomeprazole have been undertaken for species from three trophic levels, based on internationally accepted guidelines. The most sensitive species of these is the fathead minnow. Therefore, the PNEC is based on the results from the fathead minnow early life stage test, and an assessment factor of 10 is applied, in accordance with ECHA guidance (ref. 2). PNEC = 1000/10 µg/L = 100 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.942 µg/L/100 µg/L = 0.0094, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase “Use of esomeprazole has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk”. In Swedish: ”Användning av esomeprazol har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan” under the heading ”Miljörisk”.

However, esomeprazole is rapidly degraded in aquatic sediment systems. The biological degradation of esomeprazol in aquatic sediments was assessed according to the OECD 308 Test Guideline (ref 12). In this test two different sediments were used, one with high and one with low organic matter content. Radiolabelled test substance was dosed into the overlying water and the subsequent dissipation from the water phase and partitioning and/or degradation in the sediment was observed over a 100 day test period, leaving less than 7 % of the parent substance in the sediment-water system. In both the high organic matter (HOM) and low organic matter (LOM) test vessels, esomeprazol was observed to be rapidly dissipated from the water phase and total system, with half-lives <14 days. Greater than 90 % of the partitioned radioactivity was extractable from the sediment using 3 solvent extractions of acetonitrile plus 0.5% ammonium hydroxide. HPLC analysis of the extracts showed that >95% of the 14C was associated with the parent test substance peak. Adsorption to sludge The adsorption and desorption of esomeprazole to sludge was assessed according to the OPPTS guideline 835.1110 (ref 13). The Kd(ads) was 48, indicating that esomeprazole is likely to partition into the aqueous phase during wastewater treatment. The substance has hence been assigned the phrase: “Esomeprazole is slowly degraded in the environment”. In Swedish: ”Esomeprazol bryts ned långsamt i miljön.” under the heading ”Nedbrytning”. Bioaccumulation Since Log Dow < 4, esomeprazole has low potential to bioaccumulate and the phrase “Esomeprazole has low potential for bioaccumulation” is assigned. In Swedish: ”Esomeprazol har låg potential att bioackumuleras” under the heading ”Bioackumulering”. Physical Chemistry Data – Esomeprazole Endpoint Method Test Substance Concentration Result Ref.
