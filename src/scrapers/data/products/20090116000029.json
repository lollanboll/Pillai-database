        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för lamivudin är framtagen av företaget GlaxoSmithKline för Combivir®, DOVATO, Epivir®, Kivexa, TRIZIVIR, Triumeq, Zeffix, Zeffix® Miljörisk: Användning av lamivudin har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Lamivudin bryts ned i miljön. Bioackumulering: Lamivudin har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R)/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 0.028 μg/L Where: A = 205.36 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2020, data from IQVIA). R = 0% removal rate (conservatively, it has been assumed there is no loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Green Algae (Selenastrum caprocornutum): IC50 72h (growth) > 96,900 μg/L (OECD 201) (Reference 7) NOEC > 96,900 μg/L Water flea (Daphnia magna): Acute toxicity EC50 48 h (immobility) > 1,000,000 μg/L (OECD 202) (Reference 5) NOEC > 1,000,000 μg/L Water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia): Chronic toxicity EC50 7 days (reproduction) > 100,000 μg/L (EPA 1002) (Reference 10) NOEC = 100,000 μg/L Water flea (Daphnia magna): Chronic toxicity EC50 21 days (reproduction) > 100,000 μg/L (OECD 211) (Reference 12) NOEC = 100,000 μg/L Rainbow Trout (Juvenilee Oncorhyncus mykiss): Acute toxicity LC50 96 h (lethality) > 97,700 μg/L (OECD 203) (Reference 8) NOEC = 97,700 μg/L Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas): Chronic toxicity LC50 96 h (lethality) > 10,000 μg/L (OECD 210) (Reference 13) NOEC = 10,000 μg/L Other ecotoxicity data: Microorganisms in activated sludge EC50 3 hours (Inhibition) > 1,000,000 μg/L (OECD 209) (Reference 11) NOEC = 1,000,000 μg/L Chironomid (Chironomus riparius) NOEC 28 days (development) = 100,000 μg/kg (OECD 218) (Reference 14) PNEC = 10,000/10 = 1,000 μg/L PNEC (μg/L) = lowest NOEC/10, where 10 is the assessment factor applied for three long-term NOECs. NOEC for fish (= 10,000 ug/L) has been used for this calculation since it represents the lowest value for all three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.028/1,000 = 2.80 x 10-5, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 1 which justifies the phrase “Use of lamivudine has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: < 1% degradation in 28 days (OECD 301B) (Reference 4) Inherent degradability: 0% degradation in 28 days (OECD 302B) (Reference 9) 4% primary (loss of parent) degradation in 28 days 15-24% degradion in soil (TAD 3.12) (Reference 3) Simulation studies: Water-sediment study: 50% (DT50) decline (total system) = 22-29 days (OECD 308) (Reference 14) Total Lamivudine (day 100) = 0.4% - 0.6% CO2 = 8.50% - 12.60% Total Non-extractable residue = (day 100) = 18.60% - 19.10% Extraction methods: The non-extractable radioactivity in the samples taken at 100 days was characterised using an acid/base fractionation procedure. Sediment debris was extracted with 0.5 M sodium hydroxide by shaking on an orbital shaker overnight at ambient temperature. The debris was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant removed. The debris was washed with 0.5 M sodium hydroxide and allowed to air-dry. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and left to stand at ambient temperature. The sample was centrifuged, the precipitate washed with 1 M HCl and the supernatant combined with these washings. The volume of this solution, the fulvic acid fraction, was measured and duplicate aliquots taken for radio-assay. The precipitate, the humic acid fraction, was dissolved in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide. Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: Half-life, pH 7 > 1 year (OECD 111) (Reference 4) Photolysis: No data Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Lamivudine is not readily biodegradable nor inherently biodegradable. Lamivudine DT50 < 32 days and the presence of the parent is < 15%. The phrase “Lamivudine is degraded in the environment” is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Dow = -1.44 at pH7. (TAD 3.02) (Reference 3) Log Dow at pH5 = -1.17 Log Dow at pH7 = -1.44 Log Dow at pH9 = -1.86 Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Dow < 4, the substance has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Lamivudine is predominately cleared unchanged by renal excretion. The likelihood of metabolic interactions of lamivudine with other medicinal products is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma protein binding. (Reference 2) PBT/vPvB assessment Lamivudine does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP. All three properties, i.e. ‘P’, ‘B’ and ‘T’ are required in order to classify a compound as PBT (Reference 1). Lamivudine does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP based on a log Dow < 4.
