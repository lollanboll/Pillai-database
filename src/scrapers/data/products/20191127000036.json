        "env-effect": "Bedakilin Miljörisk: Särskilt miljöfarliga egenskaper PBT/vPvB-klass: I enlighet med EU:s fastställda kriterier ska substansen betraktas som en PBT/vPvB-substans Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A*(100-R) PEC = 0.000105864 µg/L Where: A = total actual API sales in Sweden for the most recent year 0.77272888 kg (total sold amount API in the most recent sales data for Sweden (2022) was distributed by IQVIA in 2023) R = 0 P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference I) D = factor for dilution of wastewater by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference I) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) (guideline e.g. OECD 201) [Reference II] EγC50 72 h (yield) > 0.77 µg/L NOECγ (yield) ≥ 0.77 µg/L ErC50 72 h (growth) > 0.77 µg/L NOECr (growth) ≥ 0.77 µg/L Crustacean (Daphnia magna) (water-flea): Acute toxicity Not available. Chronic toxicity Reproduction test with water-flea (Daphnia magna) (OECD 211) [Reference III]: NOEC 21 days (endpoint: mortality) ≥ 4.7 µg/L Fish: Acute toxicity Not available. Chronic toxicity Fish early life stage test with zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) (OECD 210) [Reference IV]: NOEC 28 days (endpoint: mortality) ≥ 4.1 µg/L Other ecotoxicity data: Activated sludge respiration inhibition test (OECD 209) [Reference IX] EC50 3h > 1000 mg/L NOEC 3h ≥ 1000 mg/L PNEC (µg/l) = lowest NOEC/10, where 10 is the assessment factor used. NOEC for the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata of 0.77 µg/L has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive of the three tested species. PNEC = 0.77 µg/L/10 = 0.077 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.000105864 /0.077 = 0.00137485528 i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 The calculated PEC/PNEC ratio is ≤ 0.1. Hence, risk assessment procedures would indicate that bedaquiline would have insignificant long-term risk to the environment. However, the half-life in the environment is > 120 days, the BCF is > 2000 and the chronic toxicity is < 0.01 mg/L (NOEC). Bedaquiline should therefore be regarded as a PBT substance, according to ECHA Guidance criteria, and as such the current PEC/PNEC ratio may underestimate the potential for long-term risk to aquatic organisms. Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: Bedaquiline was investigated for its ready biodegradation in a 28-day manometric respirometry test according to OECD 301F [Reference V]: Result: Not readily biodegradable. Inherent degradability: - Simulation studies: Aerobic degradation in aquatic sediment systems: Bedaquiline was investigated for its aerobic degradation in a 100-day aquatic sediment test, according to OECD 308 [Reference VI]: The rates of dissipation (DT50 and DT90) of bedaquiline from the water phase and the entire system were calculated using first order kinetics: System Water Total system DT50 (Days) DT90 (Days) DT50 (Days) DT90 (Days) River 2.7 9.0 257 >1 year Pond 2.3 7.7 163 >1 year In aerobic aquatic sediment systems, bedaquiline rapidly dissipated from the water phase by adsorption to the sediment. Once in the sediment, bedaquiline was slowly degraded and formation of bound residues was observed. Conclusion for degradation: Bedaquiline is potentially persistent. Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: - Photolysis: - Bioaccumulation Partition coefficient octanol/water: The partition coefficient octanol/water was determined using the shaking flask method. [Reference VII] log Dow = 2.93 (pH = 3) Bioconcentration factor (BCF): The bioconcentration and depuration characteristics of bedaquiline in the rainbow trout in a flow through system were examined according to OECD 305 [Reference VIII]. BCFlow dose = 1433 BCFhigh dose = 2049 The BCF value of the high dose indicates that bedaquiline bioconcentrates in the rainbow trout. Conclusion for bioaccumulation: Bedaquiline has high potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) - PBT/vPvB assessment PBT-criteria Results for BDQ Persistence Half-life in freshwater: DT50 > 40 days Half-life in sediment: DT50 > 120 days DT50,river = 2.7 days DT50,system = 257 days Bioaccumulation BCF > 2000 BCF = 1433 (low dose) and 2049 (high dose) Toxicity Chronic NOEC < 10 µg/L NOECalgae = 0.77 µg/L NOECdaphnia = 4.7 µg/L NOECfish = 4.1 µg/L Conclusion for PBT-assessment: According to the established EU-criteria bedaquiline should be regarded as a PBT substance.
