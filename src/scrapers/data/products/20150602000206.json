Metabolism After oral administration, quetiapine is eliminated almost completely by metabolism, as < 1% of the dose is excreted with urine and faeces as unaltered parent. Approximately 73% of the dose is excreted as metabolites in urine and 21% is excreted in faeces.

PNEC (Predicted No Effect Concentration) Long-term tests have been undertaken for species from three trophic levels, based on internationally accepted guidelines. Therefore, the PNEC is based on the results from the chronic toxicity to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), the most sensitive species, and an assessment factor of 10 is applied, in accordance with ECHA guidance (ref. 10). PNEC = 100 µg /L/10 = 10 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.33 μg/L /10.0 μg/L = 0.033 PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase: “Use of Quetiapine has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” In Swedish: “Användning av Quetiapin har bedömts medföra försumbar risk”.

The test ended after 28 days. The results showed that quetiapine fumarate is not readily biodegradable. Aerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems The degradation of quetiapine fumarate in aquatic sediment systems was assessed according to the OECD 308 Test Guideline. Two different sediments were used, one with high organic matter (HOM) and one with low organic matter (LOM) content over the 101 day test period. In both, the high and low organic matter test vessels, quetiapine fumarate rapidly dissipated from the water phase and there was no evidence of mineralisation. In HOM sediment there was evidence to show that quetiapine fumarate was degraded, but there was insufficient analytical data to quantify the rate. The LOM sediment showed no evidence of quetiapine present. At the end of the study, <15% parent compound was reported to remain in the HOM system, with 14% remaining in the sediment phase and any remaining in the water phase being below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10%. The study reported no parent compound remaining in the LOM total system, indicating any parent compound residue was below the LOQ. Based on the data available, the study passes the criteria for ‘the substance is degraded in the environment’ (DT50 of both systems is ≤ 32 days and <15% parent remaining at the end of the study). However, the whole system DT50s are not reported due to issues with the analytical method and the 101-day data point for the water phase in the HOM system is missing (and 1% or more of parent compound remaining in this sample would take the total amount of parent remaining above 15% for the HOM system). It is therefore considered appropriate to conservatively conclude that: ‘Quetiapine is slowly degraded in the environment’. In Swedish: ‘Quetiapin bryts ned långsamt i miljön’.
