        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för desloratadin är framtagen av företaget MSD för Aerius®, Azomyr®, Neoclarityn® Miljörisk: Användning av desloratadin har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Desloratadin är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Desloratadin har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Detailed background information Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.5*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 0.069 μg/L Where: A = 462 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2019, data from IQVIA) (Ref. I) R = 0 % removal rate (worst case assumption) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 9 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Ref. II) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Ref. II) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Crustacean, water flea (Daphnia magna): Acute toxicity EC50 48h = 9600 μg/L (endpoint: immobilization; FDA 4.08) (Ref. III) Chronic toxicity NOEC 21d = 480 μg/L (endpoint: mean total length; OECD 211) (Ref. IV) Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus): Acute toxicity LC50 96h = 9200 μg/L (endpoint: mortality; FDA 4.11) (Ref. V) Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) Chronic Toxicity NOEC 32d = 120 μg/L (endpoints: reproduction and growth; OECD 210) (Ref VI) Green Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata): EC50 72h = 1600 μg/L (endpoint: growth; OECD 201) (Ref. VII) NOEC = 360 μg/L (endpoint: growth; OECD 201) (Ref. VII) PNEC = 12 μg/L (120 µg/L / 10 based on the most sensitive chronic NOEC for the fathead minnow and an assessment factor (AF) of 10) Environmental Risk Classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.069/12 = 0.006, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase \"Use of desloratadine has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.\" Degradation Biotic degradation Degradability: The degradability of desloratadine was determined using the carbon dioxide evolution method (FDA 3.11). Flasks of 0.098 mg/mL of desloratadine were incubated aerobically in the dark for a period of 28 days. The day 28 mean cumulative 14CO2 evolved from aqueous media dosed with 14C-desloratadine was 0.0% of the initial 14C-desloratadine applied and the mean cumulative 14C-volatile organic products evolved from the aqueous media dosed with 14C-desloratadine was also 0.0% of the initial 14C-desloratadine applied. Mass balance at the end of the experiment ranged from 93.3 to 100.6%. Based on these results, desloratadine did not degrade under laboratory conditions during this study. Therefore an exact half-life could not be determined and is, therefore, estimated to be greater than 28 days (Ref VIII). Sediment Transformation: The degradation of desloratadine was determined according to OECD 308B. The DT50 for the total water/sediment system was determined to be 193 to 433 days (Ref IX). Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: Desloratadine is hydrolytically stable with greater than 90% of the initial concentrations remaining after 5 days at 50°C. It has a half-life of greater than 1 year at 25°C (FDA 3.09) (Ref. X) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Desloratadine is not considered degradable, thus the phrase “desloratadine is potentially persistent” is chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Kow = 1.24 at pH 7 (Shake Flask Method; OECD 107) (Ref. XI) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Kow < 4, desloratadine has low potential for bioaccumulation.
