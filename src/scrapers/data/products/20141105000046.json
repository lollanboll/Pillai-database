        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för naloxon är framtagen av företaget DNE Pharma för Respinal Miljörisk: Risk för miljöpåverkan av naloxon kan inte uteslutas då det inte finns tillräckliga ekotoxikologiska data. Nedbrytning: Naloxon är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Naloxon har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (µg/l) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.5*10-6*A*(100-R) Where: A (kg/year) = (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2019, data from IQVIA). R (%) = removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation = 0 if no data is available) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 9*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (Ref 1) D = factor of dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (Ref 1) PEC calculation for naloxone A = 52.84102 kg (addition of 52,84047 kg (naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate) and 0,00055 kg (naloxone hydrochloride, anhydrous)) R = 0 PEC (µg/l) = 1.5*10-4*A = 0.0079 μg/L Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) EC50 72 hours (growth rate) = 51.2 mg/L = 51 200 μg/L NOEC 72 hours (growth rate) = 2.67 mg/L = 2670 μg/L Guideline: OECD 201 (Growth Inhibition Test) (Ref II) Crustacean (Daphnia sp.) EC50 48 hours (mobility) > 100 mg/L = 100 000 μg/L Guideline: OECD 202 (Acute Immobilisation Test) (Ref III) Fish: No data available. Other ecotoxicity data: PNEC: No PNEC can be calculated since there is not sufficient ecotoxicity data available. Environmental Risk Classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) Risk of environmental impact of naloxone cannot be excluded since there is not sufficient data available to calculate a PEC/PNEC ratio. According to the European Medicines Agency guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), use of naloxone is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment, because the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is below the action limit 0.01 µg/L. Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: The degradation rate of naloxone was 0 % after 28 days. Guideline: OECD 301 F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) Naloxone is considered to be not readily biodegradable. (Ref IV) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Naloxone is potentially persistent. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: log Kow: 2.09 (method and pH not found) (Ref V) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Kow < 4, naloxone has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Naloxone is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, with naloxone-3-glucoronide as the major metabolite.
