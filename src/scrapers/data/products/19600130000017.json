        "env-effect": "Xylometazolin Miljörisk: Användning av xylometazolin har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Xylometazolin är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Xylometazolin har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R)/(365*P*V*D*100) PEC = 0.013 μg/L Where: A = 93,77 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2019, derived from data from IQVIA). Reduction of A may be justified based on metabolism data. R = 0% removal rate (conservatively, it has been assumed there is no loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Reference 1) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies: Green algae: EC50 = 2.03 mg/L (Desmodesmus subspicatus, 72 h (growth rate), (OECD 201) (Reference 2) Daphnia acute toxicity: EC50 = 5.63 mg/L (Daphnia magna, 48h, OECD 202) (Reference 2) Fish acute toxicity: LC50 = 71 mg/L (Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), 96h, OECD203) (Reference 2) Bacterial Respiration Inhibition: IC20 = 90 mg/L (activated sludge, 0.5h, OECD 209) (Reference 2) The PNEC is based on the following data: PNEC (µg/l) = lowest acute EC50 / 1,000, where 1,000 is the assessment factor used. An EC50 of 2.03 mg/l for green algae has been used for this calculation PNEC = 2,030 µg/L /1000 = 2.03 µg/l PNEC (μg/L) = lowest NOEC/1,000, where 1000 is the assessment factor applied for three short-term EC50s. EC50 for green algae (= 2.03 mg/L) has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive of the three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.013/2.03 = 6,40 x 10-3, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase “Use of Xylometazoline has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.” Environmental fate studies: Degradation: Degradation: < 10% (aerobic, 28d, 20-24°C, OECD 301A) (Reference 2) This substance is not readily biodegradable. Bioaccumulation Partition Coefficient: log Kow 2.84 (OECD107) (Reference 2) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Kow < 4, the substance has low potential for bioaccumulation. PBT/vPvB assessment Xylometazoline does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP. All three properties, i.e. ‘P’, ‘B’ and ‘T’ are required in order to classify a compound as PBT (Reference 1). Xylometazoline does not fulfil the criteria for PBT and/or vBvP based on log Kow < 4.
