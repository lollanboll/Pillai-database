        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för ranibizumab är framtagen av företaget Novartis för Lucentis® Miljörisk: Användning av aminosyror, proteiner och peptider bedöms inte medföra någon miljöpåverkan. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline for Environmental Risk Assessment of pharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), an ERA consisting of a justification for not submitting ERA studies is sufficient for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients: “In the case of products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should be provided. This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. The same applies to vaccines and herbal medicinal products.” Ranibizumab, the active ingredient of Lucentis, is a recombinant humanized IgG1 κ isotype monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that selectively binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The medicinal product is an aqueous solution of ranibizumab in histidine, trehalose and polysorbate 20, all of which are either naturally occurring substances or have been shown to have no significant impact on the environment. It can be expected that Lucentis after application to the patient’s eye by injection is completely metabolized and adsorbed in the body. Any medicinal product that reaches water streams via eventual spills during application or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very rapidly degraded and mineralized to CO2 by microbial activity. It is therefore expected that ranibizumab constitutes no risk to the environment. References EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.
