Bioackumulering: Amlodipin har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6 * A * (100 - R) = 1.37*10-6 * 1874.12 kg * 100 = 0.256754 μg/L Where: A = 1874.12 kg (total sold amount of amlodipinbesilat in Sweden year 2022, data from IQVIA). R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0, if no data is available. P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 * 106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (ECHA 2008) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (ECHA 2008).

NOEC for green algae growth inhibition has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive endpoint of the three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.26 µg/L / 2.9 µg/L = 0.09, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase \"Use of amlodipine has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.\" Degradation Biotic degradation Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems (OECD 308) (NOTOX Project 464535): 14C-labelled Amlodipine (VAA489) was incubated aerobically in the laboratory in two non­contaminated water/sediment systems (Goorven [GV] and Schoonrewoerdse Wiel [SW]) at 20 ± 2°c in the dark for 99 days. The initial test substance concentration in the water layer was 0.25 mg/L (GV) and 0.26 mg/L (SW). Duplicate samples of each water/sediment system were taken at 0 (single sample), and after 1, 4, 8, 21, 49, and 99 days. Volatiles were trapped by polyurethane foam, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and NaOH traps. The water layer and the sediment layer were analysed (extraction of sediment with acetonitrile and acetonitrile: buffer pH 4 3:1 (v/v)). Bound residues were determined by combustion. For t=99 (GV)/49 (SW) days, bound residues were fractionated into fulvic acids, humic acids, and humins. Extracts were analysed by HPLC. Amlodipine (VAA489) was identified based on a comparison of retention time with a reference standard; identification was confirmed by a second HPLC method. Upon addition of Amlodipine (VAA489) to the water layer, Amlodipine (VAA489) is partitioned between the water and sediment layer. In the sediment, Amlodipine (VAA489) is degraded to metabolites that desorb again, causing an increase of the radioactivity in the water layer halfway through the incubation period. At the end of the study, Amlodipine (VAA489) had completely dissipated from both the water layer and the sediment (≤0.4% of applied). Mineralization was a very minor process in both water/sediment systems (0.5-1% CO2 at the end of the study). Bound residues accounted for ~ 25% of the applied substance. The bound residues of one replicate of the t=99/49 days (GV/SW) samples were fractionated into fulvic and humic acids and humins (9/49/43 [GV] and 19/10/73% [SW] of the bound residues). The mass balances for the Goorven system ranged from 94 to 100% of applied radioactivity up to t=49 days and 87% after 99 days. The mass balances (mean values) for the Schoonrewoerdsewiel system ranged from 96 to 99% of applied radioactivity. Metabolites In the GV system, two significant metabolites (>10% of applied) were observed, one of which reached a maximum of 72% of applied and matched with degradation product DP-B that was detected in a photolysis study with VAA489 AMLO and identified as dehydro-amlodipine. The other metabolite represented 11% of applied or less. In the SW system, five significant metabolites were detected, each of which exceeded 10% of applied only once or twice and represented ≤18% of applied with one exception. Met 1, which represented up to 57% of the applied radioactivity, may consist of more than one metabolite (group) based on its peak shape. The Amlodipine (VAA489) DT50 and DT90 values and coefficients of determination are given below.

Therefore, the phrase \"the substance is degraded in the environment\" is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log D = - 0.056 (NOTOX 490975) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log D at an environmentally relevant pH is < 4, Amlodipine has a low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. PBT/vPvB assessment Based on the available information, amlodipine does not fulfill the screening criteria for a bioaccumulative substance and can therefore not be considered a potential PBT substance.

Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6 * A * (100 - R) = 1.37*10-6 * 1922.79 * 100 = 0.263 μg/L Where: A = 1922.79 kg valsartan (sum of 1272.86 kg valsartan and 649.63 kg as valsartan proportion from amount of valsartan in 1429.04 kg sakubitril-valsartannatriumhydrat*) (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2021, data from IQVIA). *The molecular weight of sacubritil-valsartan (Entresto®) is 1916 g/mol, and this contains two molecules of valsartan (435.5 g/mol x 2), so approx. 45.46% of the sacubritil-valsartan sodium hydrate corresponds to valsartan, which implies that the 1429.04 kg correspond to 649.63 kg valsartan. R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0, if no data is available.

The NOEC for Daphnia magna reproduction has been used for this calculation. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.263 μg/L / 560 μg/L = 0.00047, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase \"Use of valsartan has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk.\" Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: 0 % degradation in 28 days, not readily biodegradable (92/69/EC (L383) C.4-C). (ECOTOXICOLOGY CIGY NO. 948127) Simulation studies: DT50 (total system) = 12.0 – 16.1 days DT90 (total system) = 39.8 – 53.6 days (OECD 308, 191 days). (RCC Study No. B40590) < 15 % parent substance remaining at the end of the study 45-50 % non-extractable residues at the end of the study (up to two times: acetonitrile:water (4:1, v/v), followed by soxhlet acetonitrile: water (4:1, v/v)) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: According to the pass criteria for OECD308 studies, valsartan can be classified as ‘Valsartan is degraded in the environment' (DT50 for total system < 32 days) Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: Log Dow = 1.2 at pH 7 (OECD117) Log P = 2.8 at pH 2.5 (NOTOX Project 490979) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Dow < 4 at pH 7, valsartan has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Valsartan is primarily eliminated in feces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
