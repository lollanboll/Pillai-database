R (%) = removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) R = 0. P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (default, Ref 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (default, Ref 1) (Note: The factor 109 converts the quantity used from kg to μg). PEC = 1.37 * 10-6 * 23.54 * (100-0) = 0.0032 μg/L (Note: Whilst dapagliflozin is metabolised in humans, little is known about the ecotoxicity of the metabolites. Hence, as a worst case, for the purpose of this calculation, it is assumed that 100% of excreted metabolites have the same ecotoxicity as parent dapagliflozin). Metabolism Dapagliflozin is rapidly adsorbed and extensively metabolised. Dapagliflozin and its related metabolites are primarily eliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin (Ref 2). After administration of a 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug (Ref 3). Therefore, the patient use of dapagliflozin is likely to result mainly in metabolites and, to a lesser extent, the active moiety entering the environment.

Therefore, the PNEC is based on the results from the chronic toxicity to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), the most sensitive species, and an assessment factor of 10 is applied, in accordance with ECHA guidance (Ref. 10). PNEC = 1000/10 µg/L = 100 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC = 0.0032 µg/L PNEC = 100 µg/L PEC/PNEC = 3.2 x 10-5 The PEC/PNEC ratio is < 0.1 which justifies the phrase: ‘Use of dapagliflozin has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk’.

The degradation of dapagliflozin in aquatic sediment systems was assessed according to the OECD 308 Test Guideline. In this test two different sediments were used, one with high organic matter (HOM) and one with low organic matter content (LOM). Radiolabelled test substance was dosed into the overlying water and the subsequent dissipation from the water phase, and partitioning and/or degradation in the sediment, was observed over a 99 day test period. Since mineralisation was very strong the test vessels were kept to monitor CO2 production over 148 days. The partitioning of dapagliflozin in aquatic sediment systems appears to stop at Day 8 and no further significant amounts of radioactivity moved into the sediment. Afterwards degradation and mineralisation took place, apparently in the water phase. Transformation of dapagliflozin into a possible seven transformation products was rapid as was partitioning to the sediment. Extensive mineralisation was seen in both the high and low organic matter sediment vessels with 35 and 68%, respectively of the applied radioactivity produced as CO2 after 99 days. Following extensive sediment extration, using a variety of organic solvents of varying polarity, a significant proportion of the applied radioactivity, 44% in the high organic matter system and 24% in the low organic matter system, on Day 99, remained as non-extractable residue (NER). At Day 99 the amount of applied radioactivity removed from the total system as 14CO2 and NER, accounted for 79 and 92% in the high and low organic matter sediment vessels, respectively. Accordingly the half life of dapagliflozin in both aquatic sediment systems is <120 days. Based on the data above dapagliflozin has been assigned the risk phrase: ‘Dapagliflozin is slowly degraded in the environment.’ In Swedish: “Dapagliflozin bryts ned långsamt i miljön.” under the heading “Nedbrytning”. Bioaccumulation Dapagliflozin is not ionisable within the environmentally relevant pH range (estimated pKa = 12.6). The octanol-water partition coefficient was 2.34, measured at pH 7.4. Since Log POW < 4, dapagliflozin has low potential to bioaccumulate and the phrase “Dapagliflozin has low potential for bioaccumulation” is assigned. In Swedish: ”Dapagliflozin har låg potential att bioackumuleras” under the heading “Bioackumulering”.
