Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 0.02911661 μg/L Where: A = 212.53 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2020, data from IQVIA). Reduction of A may be justified based on metabolism data. R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) . P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Ref. 1) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Ref. 1) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Endpoint Species Common Name Method Time Result Ref EC50 - based on growth rate Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata Green Algea OECD 201 72 h 9.8 mg/L 2 EC50 - based on yield 4.5 mg/L NOEC – based on growth rate & yield 2.4 mg/L EC50 Daphnia magna Water Flea OECD 202 48 h 25 mg/L 3 NOEC 4.4 mg/L NOEC – based on survival & reproduction OECD 211 21 d 1.3 mg/L 4 EC50 - based on reproduction >4.9 mg/L LC50 Brachydanio rerio Zebra Fish OECD 203 96 h 77 mg/L 5 NOEC 12 mg/L NOEC – based on early-life stage Pimephales promelas Fathead Minnow OECD 210 0.53 mg/L 6 LOEC – based on early-life stage 1.0 mg/L EC50 - based on Activated Sludge Respiration Inhibition OECD 209 3 h 586 mg/L 7 1NOEC - based on Activated Sludge Respiration Inhibition 95.9 mg/L EC50 - based on emergence Chironomus riparius Midge OECD 218 571 mg/kg 8 NOEC - based on emergence 250 mg/kg 1Calculated as the EC15, the Effective Concentration affecting 15% of population tested Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) Long-term tests have been undertaken for species from three trophic levels, based on internationally accepted guidelines. The most sensitive species of these is the fathead minnow. Therefore, the PNEC is based on results from the assessment of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) study, NOEC = 530 µg/L and an assessment factor of 10 is applied, in accordance with ECHA guidance (Ref. 9). PNEC = 530 µg/L / 10 = 53 µg/L PEC/PNEC = 0.02911661/53 = 0.00054937, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase 'Use of tapentadol has been considered to result in insignificant risk.' Degradation Readily Biodegradation Tapentadol was investigated for its ready biodegradation in a 28 day CO2 Evolution Modified Sturm Test, according to OECD Guideline 301B (Reference 10). Based on the results of this study, tapentadol is not readily biodegradable according to the OECD Guideline 301B. Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems Tapentadol was investigated for its aerobic degradation in a 100 day aquatic sediment test, according to OECD Guideline 308 (ref 11). Primary degradation was observed for [14C]tapentadol in the aerobic water/sediment test samples. One major degradation product was observed at >10% of the radioactivity during the study and numerous minor degradation products (<10% of the radioactivity for individual degradants) were observed in the HPLC analyses. Ultimate biodegradation was minimally observed in the aerobic test systems. The accumulative amount of evolved 14CO2 was 0.9% of the radioactivity for the Taunton River aerobic test systems and 1.3% of the radioactivity for the Weweantic aerobic test systems at Day 101. The DT50 (half-life) for the aerobic primary degradation of [14C]tapentadol in the water layer ranged from 1.3 days to 3.3 days. The DT50 for the aerobic primary degradation of [14C]tapentadol in the water/sediment test systems ranged from 41 days to 126 days. Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems Tapentadol was investigated for its anaerobic degradation in a 100 day aquatic sediment test, according to OECD Guideline 308 (reference 11). Primary degradation was observed for [14C]tapentadol in the anaerobic water/sediment test samples. Numerous minor degradation products (<10% of the radioactivity for individual degradants) were observed in the HPLC analyses. Ultimate biodegradation was minimally observed in the anaerobic test systems. The accumulative amount of evolved 14CO2 was less than 1% for the Goose River and Golden Lake anaerobic test systems at Day 101. No radioactivity was detected in the volatile organic and 14CH4 trapping systems for the anaerobic test systems at Day 101. The DT50 for the anaerobic primary degradation of [14C]tapentadol in the water layer ranged from 10.7 days to 22.8 days. The DT50 for the anaerobic primary degradation of [14C]tapentadol in the water/sediment test systems ranged from 51 days to 60 days. Information on the Extraction Method of Sediment Residues The above mentioned aerobic and anaerobic sediments varied in textural characteristics, organic matter content and microbial content (Taunton River aerobic, Weweantic River aerobic, Goose River anaerobic and Golden Lake anaerobic sediments). The untreated flooded sediment samples (50 g dry weight sediment plus 150 mL water) were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for at least one week. Following incubation, [14C]tapentadol was applied to the water layers of each of the systems to achieve a final nominal concentration of approximately 1 mg/L in the water layer. A flow-through test system was used in order to determine the aerobic rate and route of degradation of [14C]tapentadol at a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C continuously in the dark. For the aerobic test systems, the aerobic environment was maintained by continuously bubbling hydrated air through the water layer for 103 days. The anaerobic test systems were prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere and tightly sealed throughout the study to ensure anaerobic test conditions. All test systems used potassium hydroxide (KOH) and ethylene glycol organic volatile traps to collect 14CO2 and any volatile components that evolved during the study. Water and sediment samples from all test systems were assayed at 0, 4, 10, 28, 60 and 101 days after application of the test substance. The test conditions outlined in the study protocol were maintained throughout the study. Based on the data above the phrase ‘Tapentadol is slowly degraded in the environment’ is chosen. Bioaccumulation The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) indicates the transfer of the active substance from the aquatic environment into organisms and a potential to bioaccumulate. The log Kow for tapentadol is 2.89 (reference 12), which is below 4. Consequently, tapentadol has a low tendency to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and no bioconcentration test is required and the statement 'Tapentadol has low potential for bioaccumulation' is assigned.
