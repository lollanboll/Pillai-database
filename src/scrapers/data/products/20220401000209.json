        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för omeprazol är framtagen av företaget Cheplapharm för Losec® Miljörisk: Användning av omeprazol har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Omeprazol är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Omeprazol har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Total sales of esomeprazole and omeprazole are included in the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC), as a worst case, as esomeprazole is the S-enantiomer of the racemate omeprazole and the toxicity is assumed to be very similar. Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) Where: A = total sold amount API in Sweden year 2022, data from IQVIA (Ref I). R (%) = removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0 if no data is available . P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Ref. II) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Ref. II) (Note: The factor 109 converts the quantity used from kg to μg). A = 8 171.9377 kg. This figure is based on sales figures (286.0346 kg esomeprazole magnesium + 1262.6530 kg esomeprazole magnesiumdihydrate + 63.6454 kg esomeprazole magnesiumtrihydrate + 246.4380 kg esomeprazole sodium + 6239.9573 kg omeprazole 73.2094 kg omeprazolmagnesium) R = 0 PEC = 1.37 x 10-6 x 8 171.9377 (100-0) = 1.1196 µg/L (Note: Whilst esomeprazole and omeprazole are extensively metabolised, little is known about the ecotoxicity of the excreted metabolites. Hence, a total residue approach is taken where no metabolism of parent compound is considered; a worst case assumption.)

Note 2: The population relevant endpoints measured were survival, fecundity and adult length. Note 3: Concentrations were confirmed by analysis, and results expressed as nominal. Note 4: The population relevant endpoints measured were total number of emerged adult insects, sex ratio and replicate mean plus individual emergence times (development rates). Note 5: The population relevant endpoints measured were hatch, survival, length and dry weight. Note 6: Results are expressed as nominal concentrations. Note 7: Data from studies on omeprazole sodium. Note 8: Data from studies on omeprazole. PNEC (Predicted No Effect Concentration) The lowest LC50 value presented in the table above for Omeprazol is 41.9 mg/L (equivalent to 41 900 µg/L) and an assessment factor of 1000 is applied to calculate PNEC for Omeprazol (ref VII). PNEC =41 900 µg/L /1000 =41.9 µg/L Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 1.1196/41.9= 0.027, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 1 which justifies the phrase “Use of Omeprazol has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk”.

Biodegradation Omeprazole was found not to be readily biodegradable in biodegradability studies. The substance has hence been assigned the phrase: “Omeprazol is potentially persistent”. In Swedish: ”Omeprazol är potentiellt persistent” under the heading ”Nedbrytning”. Bioaccumulation Since Log D < 4, Omeprazole has low potential to bioaccumulate and the phrase “Omeprazole has low potential for bioaccumulation” is assigned (Ref VIII). In Swedish: ”Omeprazol har låg potential att bioackumuleras” under the heading ”Bioackumulering”.
